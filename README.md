Overview
Task Calendar Dashboard is a frontend application built with a focus on clarity and reliability. It centers on calendar-driven task management and combines this with modern analytics. The user can schedule tasks, assign priorities, set reminders, and view analytics that reveal work patterns, workload distribution, and progress trends. The app is designed for teams and individuals who want a single, integrated view of tasks and outcomes.

The project embraces a modular architecture. It uses a robust type system, a proven state-management approach, and a UI library that supports complex layouts without sacrificing accessibility. It intentionally separates concerns so developers can extend features with confidence while maintaining a smooth user experience for end users.

Key features
- Calendar-based task planning: Create, edit, drag, and drop tasks across days and weeks.
- Task attributes: Title, description, due date, priority, status, tags, and progress percentage.
- Smart analytics: Visualizations that show task completion rates, workload distribution, and sprint progress.
- Form handling: Robust forms with validation, using a modern form library for a strong developer experience.
- Validation: Real-time validation rules that prevent invalid data from entering the system.
- UI framework: A polished look and feel built on a robust UI library, with consistent theming and components.
- Charting: Rich charts for analytics, powered by a charting library to visualize trends.
- State management: Scalable state management with a toolkit designed for predictable updates.
- Data persistence: Client-side storage with sensible defaults, plus a clean API surface for future backend integration.
- Theming and branding: Easy customization for color schemes and typography to fit your brand.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility to reach a wider audience.
- Internationalization readiness: Ready for multiple languages and date formats with minimal changes.
- Testing: A testing strategy that covers components, hooks, and user flows.

Design and UX principles
- Clarity first: Clear labels, readable typography, and unambiguous controls.
- Consistency: Reusable components across the calendar, lists, and analytics views.
- Feedback: Immediate visual feedback for user actions, such as task creation or completion.
- Efficiency: Keyboard shortcuts and bulk operations to speed up daily use.
- Responsive layouts: Interfaces adapt to phone, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Accessibility: Its design accounts for assistive technologies and color contrast requirements.

Tech stack
- Frontend framework: React
- UI components: Ant Design
- Form handling: Formik
- Validation: Yup
- State management: Redux Toolkit
- Calendar interactions: Ant Design calendar components
- Charts: Recharts
- Data handling: Local storage and a clean API surface for future server integration
- Routing and navigation: React Router
- Styling: CSS-in-JS and theme tokens
- Build tooling: Modern bundler with fast refresh and tree-shaking

Architecture and data flows
- Component structure: A layered approach that separates UI, business logic, and data access.
- State slices: Feature-centric slices for tasks, calendar views, filters, and analytics data.
- Data flow: Actions trigger reducers; selectors read derived data for views; thunks handle asynchronous work like data persistence or API calls.
- Form handling: Formik manages form state; Yup provides validation schema; forms feed into the task data model.
- Calendar view: A calendar grid supports date selection, month navigation, and task assignment to specific days.
- Analytics layer: A dedicated layer computes metrics from task data and renders charts through a charting library.
- Theming: A theme system centralizes colors, typography, and component behavior for consistent branding.
